# NotepadC
Soooooo you know notepad?, welp i decided to make a notepad but with C++, its really simple but its honest work (At least for me)

# Why, but WHY i decided to do this
I decided to do this because i was bored and i started coding in c++ soo here you have it 

# Download
Sooo if you have a Unix machine you can just go throught the releases, then where you downloaded the file type ./a.out and BAM you are done!

# Compile
This requires some other things to do but i know u can do it!

First things first you need to install g++ or gcc

Have you finished installing, if not i will give you the time to install one or another

when you finished, download from the releases the file called "notepad.cpp" and in the same directory where you downloaded the file write this:

g++ notepad.cpp

ONLY IF YOU HAVE G++

gcc notepad.cpp

ONLY IF YOU HAVE GCC


NOW if you are using another compiler its almost always the name of the compiler + the name of the c++ file

# Use this file

Sooo you can look into the source code if you want but if you actually fork this and want to use it for your project remember to mention me in any way!
